# Module 1 Final Project Repository Contents

1. student.ipynb - The python notebook for the technical part of the project.

2. kc_house_data.csv - the data that was supplied for use in this project by the Flatiron school. It has not been modified.

3. The KCH_presentation.pdf is the pdf export of the Google slides presentation that corresponds to the research within this repository.

4. The KingCountyInfo.pdf file is a publication released by the King County Department of Assessments which has within it a description of the qualities which affect the grading of homes in the county. This can be found on page 29 of the report. This was referenced to make the business argument that renovating your house will be likely to appreciably raise the sale value, since the grade of your house may be positively affected by such renovations.
